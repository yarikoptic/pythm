pythm for Debian
----------------

Although it is not explicitly mentioned, this pythm package is based
on a fork of pythm primarily developed by Dylan Reilly.

An alternative fork was developed by Paul TT
   http://github.com/yarikoptic/pythm/tree/paultt-novcs

Some changes from it were adopted by Dylan, hence Paul is also
mentioned in debian/copyright.
